1. Project Structure
The app will be built using a modular approach to separate concerns and make the codebase scalable and maintainable.

Frontend Structure (Example in Flutter)
graphql
Copy code

├── models/                  # Data models (e.g., Book, User, Order)
│   ├── book_model.dart
│   ├── user_model.dart

Backend Structure (Example in Django or Node.js)

2. Development Workflow
a. Step-by-Step Development
Wireframe to Code Translation

Use the wireframe in Figma as the guide for designing screens.
Start with Home Screen, then proceed to Book Details, Search, and other screens.
Backend Development

Design RESTful APIs to fetch book data, manage users, and handle orders.
Secure sensitive data using authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
Integration

Integrate the backend with frontend screens using API services.
Testing

Write unit tests for individual components and integration tests for end-to-end flows.
b. Key Milestones
Milestone	Description	Timeline
Project Setup	Set up project structure, dependencies, and tools.	1 week
UI Development (Frontend)	Design and code all screens and components.	2-3 weeks
API Development (Backend)	Build and deploy APIs for books, users, and orders.	2 weeks
Integration	Connect frontend with backend.	1 week
Testing & Debugging	Perform manual and automated testing.	1-2 weeks
Deployment	Deploy app to Play Store/App Store and backend to cloud services (AWS, Azure, etc.).	1 week
3. Coding Guidelines
Frontend (Flutter Example)
Follow DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and SOLID principles.
Use responsive design for different screen sizes.
Manage state efficiently with tools like Provider or Riverpod.
Avoid hardcoding strings, colors, and styles; use centralized constants.
Backend
Follow RESTful API standards: use proper HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Secure endpoints with authentication and authorization.
Use environment variables for sensitive credentials (e.g., .env file).
Optimize database queries to avoid performance bottlenecks.
4. Tools & Technologies
Feature	Suggested Tool/Tech
